# Timelapser

A very very simple app to layer an image with a camera stream so that you can match both pictures before taking another picture

## Why

It's useful when I want to take a picture of myself in the exact same place I took a picture before. This tool helps with the alignment of the picture by allowing me to compare the background with the video stream.

## Requirements

Obviously you must allow your camera to be used so that a video stream can be made.
